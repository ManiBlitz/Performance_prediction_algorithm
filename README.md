### Description
The goal of this project is to realize a neural network along with the performance prediction algorithm described in the paper [Who Does What? A Novel Algorithm to Determine Function Localization](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1799-who-does-what-a-novel-algorithm-to-determine-function-localization.pdf). Along with that algorithm, we will try to associate other performance measurment algorithms whose accusracy will be compared to the one proposed.
